ALWAYS DO NLP IN THE FOLLOWING STEPS:
    1) PREPROCESSING AND CLEANING
    2) TRAIN TEST SPLIT
    3) BOW AND TF-IDF (SENTENCES--->VECTORS)
    4) TRAIN OUR MODEL

IF WE DO BOW/TF-IDF BEFORE TRAIN TEST SPLIT , THEN THE VOCAB IS BUILT CONSIDERING THE TEST DATA AS WELL, THIS CAUSES DATA LEAKAGE
IN THE IPY NOTEBOOKS , I HAVENT DONE THIS WAY , BUT IN REALITY WEHAVE TO DO THE WAY ABOVE STEPS ARE WRITTEN
